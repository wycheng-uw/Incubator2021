## Machine-learning based dry thunderstorm forecast model
Dry thunderstorms (DT) are convective storms that generate lightning flashes without significant rainfall at the ground. The frequent occurrence of DTs has long been an important safety concern in the western United States due to its connection to wildfire events. An accurate forecast for the dry thunderstorms is therefore important, but remains a difficult task because the corresponding physical mechanisms are not yet fully understood. In addition, traditional lightning parameterizations methods are often based on simplified physical intuition and are therefore limited by a small number of free parameters. Machine learning (ML) techniques enable a more ambitious approach to develop parameterizations using data-driven approach and are therefore more flexible than traditional lightning parameterizations. By utilizing the recently developed lightning observations dataset from World-Wide Lightning Location Network (WWLLN) and various atmospheric observations/reanalysis products, this study aims to improve the dry thunderstorms forecast skill in the western United States.
