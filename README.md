## Machine-learning based dry thunderstorm forecast model
Dry thunderstorm is a major cause of wildfires. This project aims to improve the dry thunderstorms forecast skill. A supervised ML-based dry thunderstorm forecast model is employed by using the observational lightning data from World-Wide Lightning Location Network (WWLLN) and various atmospheric state variables as features.

### Data Source:
- WWLLN: http://wwlln.net/
- ERA5: https://www.ecmwf.int/en/forecasts/datasets/reanalysis-datasets/era5
- GOES: https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/gridsat/

### Needs of this project:
- data exploration
- data processing/cleaning
- ML modeling
- writeup/reporting
